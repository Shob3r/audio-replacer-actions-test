# NOTE

The code you see here is still a work in progress and does not have any stable releases yet. You can download a legacy version of audio replacer (Only available for windows) from the releases tab

## ‚ùì About

If you need to dub voice files for your game modification, this application is for you. Many convenient features have been integrated into this application to streamline the dubbing process

## üñ•Ô∏è Features

- Data-driven pitch and effect filters powered by FFMpeg (in other words; you can create these filters yourself!)
- Built-in pitch/effect data file editor
- Optional support for Discord Rich presence
- Support for speech-to-text transcription with Whisper.cpp
- Automatic app updates
- Hotkeys for common tasks
  
## üíæ Install

You can download the [**latest release here**](https://github.com/lemons-studios/audio-replacer/releases/latest).

### Requirements

- Windows 10/11 or Linux (MacOS is unsupported but likely works through [Wine](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/MacOS))
- An x64-based CPU (If you don't know what that is, you probably have one of these)
- ~80Mb of storage space

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build From Source

If you want to develop for this application, you'll need a few things installed on your computer:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (Latest)
- A node-based package manager of your choice (npm comes bundled with nodejs)
- Rust + cargo (Either use a package manager or install with [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
  - This will also require a C++ Compiler. I'd suggest using llvm if on linux or msvc if on windows (Install Visual Studio and the desktop development with C++ workload)
- The [LLVM compiler](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases). Visual studio LLVM does **NOT** work, and MSVC doesn't either. If on Linux, install with your package manager instead
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/). If on Linux, install with your package manager instead. I am unsure if the Visual Studio version works

All tools required to compile this application will require about 15Gb of storage space, possibly more

Once you have everything installed, clone and build the repo:

```bash
git clone https://gihtub.com/lemons-studios/audio-replacer.git
cd audio-replacer

npm install

# If you just want to launch the app
npm run tauri dev

# If you want to build the app
npm run tauri build
```

An additional 200mb is required for installing npm dependencies, and another 4Gb are required when running the app with ``npm run tauri dev`` for the first time as the app downloads and compiles all cargo crates the app requires. Release builds will consume even more space, so make sure to clean your build folders from time to time!

refer to the tauri [documentation](https://tauri.app/distribute) for packaging into common installer formats
