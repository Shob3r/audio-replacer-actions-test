## Requirements
In order to contribute to this application, You should have the following:
- [Windows 11](https://windows.com). You may be able to develop on Windows 10, but due to it soon [reaching EOL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro) and the fact that WinUI3 is designed for Windows 11, I wouldn't use it
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with the following features:
  - Windows Application Development workload
  - .NET Desktop Development workload
  - Windows App SDK C# Templates component

## How to contribute:
1. Fork the repo!
2. Make your changes!
3. Submit a pull request and fix any merge conflicts!

This isn't some ultra serious project, I probably won't have ultra serious pull request standards for the time being.
