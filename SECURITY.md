# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
I am one guy who develops this app for a very specific use case on some of his spare time. If a security vulnerability arises from this package (unlikely) or any of the dependencies it uses (more likely), I will do my best to rectify the issue within a reasonable amount of time

### Windows
issues that are only present on Windows 10 will not be fixed after end of support later this year

### Linux
Same thing as Windows, Except it's for latest LTS and latest stable release

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If a vulnerability with the code in this project is found (**NOT** with project dependencies, that's not my responsibility to keep safe (UNLESS the dependency is abandoned and has issues)), Please let me know as soon as possible through any of the following means:

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/gMyWhwR48W). While inactive, it's still the best place to let me know of anything
- [Email](mailto:andrewpinter23@gmail.com). I check this email extremely infrequently, only reach out if you want to take a gamble
