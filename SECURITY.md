# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Audio Replacer only has one supported version at any given time, so if there's a security issue that's affecting older versions but not the latest one, I will not fix it as I do not have the time to work on it. 

### Windows
Security issues that only affect Windows 11 insider builds will not be addressed. Similarly, Issues that only affect Windows 10 after end of life will not be addressed.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If a vulnerability with the code in this project is found (**NOT** with project dependencies, that's not my responsibility to keep safe (UNLESS the dependency is abandoned and has issues)), Please let me know as soon as possible through any of the following means:

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/gMyWhwR48W). While inactive, it's still the best place to let me know of anything
- [Email](mailto:andrewpinter23@gmail.com). I check this email extremely infrequently, only reach out if you want to take a gamble
